<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>To provide a working system that will search only the things I add. With a single word or two, the system will scan the files and find anything relevant.</p>

<h2>Reason</h2>
<p>To quickly aid in providing knowledge that other search engines fail in.</p>

<p><i>This will be specific to things only relevant to science, math, and engineering. </i></p>
