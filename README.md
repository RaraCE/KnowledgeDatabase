## Definitions


<b> black body </b>: A hypothetical object absorbing all light that hits it, whatever the frequency or direction. A black body at a constant temperature emits a light spectrum (black body radiation) purely dependent on its temperature and not influenced by the nature of the body.

<b> black holes </b>: A location at which matter has been made so compact that it collapses to a point under gravitational pull. Most frequently formbed by the collapse of a massive star. The black hole itself is a singularity, a dimensionless point.

<b> complementarity </b>: Because in quantum theory the act of measurement influences the result, different measurements are complementary to each other. Complementary states that reality is netiher of these but a whole of which we can only detect a part with any one experiment.
