<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>To provide a working system that will search through documents. With a single word or two, the system will scan and extract the correct files.</p>

<h3>Reason</h3>
<p>To aid in quickly extracting bits of information rather than be overwhelmed with lots of information as the case with a lot of search engines.</p>

<p><i>This will be specific to things only relevant to science, math, chemistry, biology, genetics, and engineering. </i></p>
